Selection Sort

Divides the array into a sorted and an unsorted part.
Finds the minimum element from the unsorted part and places it at the end of the sorted part.
Time Complexity: O(n^2)

Bubble Sort

Compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
Repeats the process until the array is sorted.
Time Complexity: O(n^2)

Insertion Sort

Builds a sorted array one element at a time by inserting each element in the correct position within the already sorted part.
Time Complexity: O(n^2)

Linear Search

Sequentially searches through each element in the array until the target element is found.
Time Complexity: O(n) for an unsorted array.
